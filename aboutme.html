                    <h3>about me</h3>
                    <p>Ever since I have my own consciousness, I’m always creating art.<br> From scribbles to brush strokes, my bedroom walls to textbook pages are conquered by that creativeness. <br>When I’m bored, I create art to fill up the empty minutes. When my blood is boiling, I create art to calm myself down. <br>When I’m on cloud nine, I create art to celebrate the joy. <br>When watching the colors dance on the blank space, there’s only me, my pen, and my canvas.<br>

                My works are mostly narrative and emotional. Behind each piece, there’s a story, and behind those stories are different parts of my inner self.<br> I have various sketchbooks filled with small illustrations as my daily diary. <br>From daily happenings to significant events, they become scenes of the concepts I want to convey and manifest on my canvas. <br>However, I want my art to be something that can make people smile.<br> I want my art to be the medium that transforms frowns into grins as the sun that dries up the rain. <br>I want to have the power to cure one’s emotions and spread the warmth through the viewer’s heart.</p>
