          <h3>about me</h3>
          <p>hello! This is Gracy~ I'm someone with huge passion of art. <br>"Art is something that makes people smile" is what I always believe, it's also my driving force of creating arts.<br> Like other artists, I'm in love with art ever since I was young. <br>When I'm creating my artworks, there's nothing else but me, paper, and pen. <br>by scribbling those lines, connecting them into shapes...<br> I can somehow find peace within them. <br>In my future I would like to pursue illustration, art education, <br>and maybe art therapy as my major and minors. <br>here's one of my art accounts where I post mostly graphic design artworks,<br> feel free to follow it~ </p>

          <h3> Artworks and Styles</h3>
          <p>I do anything from tradditional art to digital ones. <br>
              Personally, I don't think I have a really clear style that can be told easily from other artists. <br>I don't really have one, but I'm on my way of finding it. </p>
